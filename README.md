\# CI/CD Secrets \& Access Hardening for DevSecOps Pipelines



\## Overview

This project demonstrates how insecure CI/CD pipelines expose secrets, over-privilege access, and violate least-privilege principles and how to harden pipelines using secure secrets handling, scoped access, and security validation.



The focus is pipeline security design, not application complexity.



\## Objective

Demonstrate:

\- Common CI/CD security anti-patterns

\- Secrets exposure risks

\- Over-privileged pipeline access

\- Hardened pipelines using least-privilege and validation controls



\## Scope

\- Show bad vs good pipeline design

\- Demonstrate secrets exposure risks

\- Enforce least privilege

\- Add security validation gates



\## Repository Structure

\- `insecure-pipeline/` : intentionally vulnerable pipeline

\- `secure-pipeline/` : hardened pipeline

\- `policies/` : security validation rules

\- `docs/` : threat model and security decisions
